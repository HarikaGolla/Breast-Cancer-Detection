# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This project implements a breast cancer detection system using Logistic Regression with the breast cancer dataset from sklearn. It involves data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The model achieves high accuracy on training and test datasets. Users can input features to predict if breast cancer is benign or malignant.
